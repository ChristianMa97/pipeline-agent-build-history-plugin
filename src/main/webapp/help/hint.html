<div>
  The very first time an extended build history page of an agent is opened (it doesn't matter which agent), it contains only those runs that have
  started since Jenkins startup. A background job is then started that will read the complete history of all jobs.
  Depending on the total number of runs this can take a considerable amount of time. The help icon which showed this help area will
  be only available while loading hasn't completed.
