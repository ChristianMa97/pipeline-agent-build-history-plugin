<div>
  The very first extended build history page that is opened after Jenkins started will contain only those runs that have
  started since then. A background job is started that will read the complete history of all jobs. It can take a few moments
  until all data is loaded (depends on the total number of runs in the instance). A refresh of the page should show the complete
  history usually.
